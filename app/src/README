1. Overview
Mentora (OTAMS Group 22) is a tutoring-management Android application designed to streamline interactions between Students, Tutors, and Admins.
Deliverable 4.0 finalizes the full system by completing the Student module and integrating all workflows across the three user roles. The application uses Firebase Authentication and Firestore to persist user accounts, tutor availability, session requests, and confirmed sessions.

2. What’s New in Deliverable 4.0
Deliverable 4 focuses on the Student experience and full system integration:
Student search by course code
Viewing tutor profiles and availability
Requesting tutoring sessions
Auto-approval or tutor-approval workflows
Conflict prevention (no overlapping or past sessions)
Real-time updates across all roles
UI polishing and final bug fixes
Complete integration of Admin → Tutor → Student flows

3. Installation Instructions
Download OTAMS_Group22_v4.0.apk.
Transfer the APK to an Android device or emulator (API 30+ recommended).
Install the application (enable "Install unknown apps" if required).
Launch the app — it appears as Mentora.

4. Admin Workflow (from D3, integrated in D4)
Admins can:
View pending tutor registration requests
Approve or reject requests
View approved and rejected lists
Manage tutor access to the system
Firestore updates reflect immediately across the application.

5. Tutor Workflow
Tutors can:
Add or remove 30-minute availability slots
View session requests from students
Approve or reject requests
View all confirmed sessions under the "Sessions" tab
Validation includes prevention of overlapping or past slots.

6. Student Workflow (Deliverable 4 Focus)
Search Tutors by Course
Students enter a course code (e.g., CSI 2110).
The system retrieves all tutors who teach that course.
View Available Slots
For each tutor:
Only valid, future, non-conflicting slots are shown.
Slots linked to existing student requests or sessions are excluded.
Request a Session
If a tutor requires approval: a PENDING request is created.
If auto-approved: the system immediately creates a confirmed session.
Students can view:
Pending requests
Approved sessions
Session details linked to tutor availability

All data updates in real time via Firestore.
Deliverable 4 completes the Mentora application with full multi-role integration, stable Firestore operations, and a clear end-to-end workflow.
This version represents a polished, functional system aligned with SEG2105 requirements.
